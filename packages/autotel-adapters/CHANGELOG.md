# autotel-adapters

## 2.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 0f518c6: Refresh dependencies to their latest minor and patch releases, most notably the
  OpenTelemetry SDK (`0.220.x` → `0.221.x`, `2.9.x` → `2.10.x`).

  Majors are deliberately held back for a separate change, including TypeScript 7,
  pnpm 11, chalk 6, jsdom 30 and the ESLint toolchain.

- 0f518c6: Stop publishing source maps. Every package is roughly half the size it was.

  Published output across all packages drops from 18.7 MiB to 7.9 MiB. Installing
  `autotel` downloads 500 KiB gzipped instead of 1,130 KiB. Nothing about the
  shipped JavaScript or type declarations changed.

  Source maps were 55–65% of every package, because each source byte was emitted
  four times: once as ESM, once as CJS, and again inside each format's map, which
  embedded `sourcesContent`. They never reached a consumer's application bundle —
  bundlers read maps and discard them — so the cost was pure install weight in
  exchange for TypeScript stack traces under `node --enable-source-maps`.

  Best-in-class TypeScript libraries do not make that trade. Of fourteen surveyed,
  twelve publish no maps at all (zod, hono, pino, fastify, vitest, vite, rollup,
  undici, commander, tsdown, react, astro), and not one publishes `.d.ts.map`.
  The OpenTelemetry packages do ship maps at around 50% of their size, which is
  the convention this repo had been following.

  The `.d.ts.map` declaration maps were broken regardless: `sourcesContent: false`
  with sources pointing at `../src/*.ts`, which `files` never published, so they
  resolved to nothing on a consumer's machine.

  Maps are still generated for local development. `tsconfig.json` keeps
  `sourceMap` and `declarationMap` on; only `tsconfig.build.json` disables them,
  so debugging the workspace is unchanged.

  This also fixes the bundle-size gate, which had been amplifying every ordinary
  change by 4×. The three packages that were failing it (`autotel-backends` +43.9%,
  `autotel-mcp` +14.4%, `autotel-schema` +12.0%) were not bloated — that growth was
  legitimate new backend code, quadrupled by the build. The baseline is
  regenerated.

## 2.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 85a0e88: Add `autotel map`, plus request lifecycle correctness fixes.

  **`autotel map`** scores the observability of every entry point in a project. It
  reads the source (no runtime, no network), detects the framework, finds every
  entry point, and reports what context you would have when each one breaks:
  whether it produces a span, whether that span carries business context, whether
  thrown errors explain themselves, whether catch blocks record the failure,
  whether money and auth paths leave an audit trail, and whether data-loading
  pages handle request failures.

  - `autotel map` — score plus the three entry points worth fixing first
  - `autotel map --all` — every entry point as a check matrix
  - `autotel map <route|file>` — one entry point, every check, and the code that fixes it
  - `autotel map --json` — every finding with `evidence` and `fix`, for agents
  - `autotel map --min-score <n>` / `--baseline [path|git:<ref>]` — CI gates; the
    baseline compares per check, so a refactor that instruments one route and
    breaks another still fails
  - `// autotel-map-disable <check> -- reason` waives a check in code; waived
    checks cost no score and are counted separately from real coverage
  - Opportunities highlight repeated inline errors in projects with an error
    catalog, and uncovered writes in projects that already record audit signals

  Frameworks: Next.js, Nitro/Nuxt, TanStack Start, SvelteKit, Hono, Express,
  Fastify, Elysia, Cloudflare Workers.

  **Request lifecycle:**

  - add `RequestLogger.setLevel()` for explicit canonical snapshot severity
  - add retry classification to `createDrainPipeline()` so permanent failures can
    be dropped without repeated delivery attempts
  - keep Next.js navigation signals out of error telemetry, including wrapped
    signals
  - defer Hono SSE, NDJSON, and AI-stream snapshots until the response body
    settles

- Updated dependencies [85a0e88]
  - autotel@6.1.0

## 2.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 756345d: Skills no longer ship inside the npm package tarballs. They now live at the repo root under `skills/`, grouped into `core/`, `frameworks/`, `integrations/`, and `contributing/`, as a single source of truth discovered by the skills CLI (`npx skills add jagreehal/autotel --skill <name>`). `skills` is removed from each package's `files` field, so installing a package no longer adds its skill to `node_modules`. Install skills explicitly with the CLI instead.
- Updated dependencies [756345d]
- Updated dependencies [756345d]
  - autotel@6.0.0
  - autotel-edge@4.0.1

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- 9030f83: Correctness fixes, strict-TS type repairs across the public API, and a
  dependency refresh. Test files are now type-checked in every package
  (`tsconfig.json` no longer excludes `*.test.ts`), which surfaced and fixed a
  batch of real public-type bugs.

  **Added (autotel):**

  - Add `autotel/slo` with rolling-window SLI tracking, error-budget snapshots,
    baseline/lookahead forecasts, OpenTelemetry metrics, span attributes, and
    dual-window burn-rate alert evaluation.
  - Add `autotel/analysis` with `compareCohorts()`: the core analysis loop as a
    pure function. Give it the events you are investigating plus a comparable
    baseline and it ranks the field/value pairs that separate them. Accepts wide
    events, `TestSpan.attributes`, or backend rows. Fields whose values never
    repeat are skipped, since a request id cannot name a cohort.
  - Add `DeterministicSampler` to `autotel/sampling` for consistent sampling.
    `RandomSampler` rolls per process, so an API can keep a trace its worker
    drops; hashing a key that travels with the request makes every service agree.
  - Add `KeyTargetRateSampler` to `autotel/sampling` for per-key target rates.
    It counts traffic per key over a rolling window and gives each key its own
    rate, so rare operations survive a skewed workload while busy ones get
    thinned. Key cardinality is bounded by `maxKeys`.
  - Add the optional `Sampler.sampleRate()` hook, recorded on spans as
    `autotel.sampling.rate` ("1 in N") by both `trace()` and the SDK-level
    sampler, so `COUNT * rate` estimates the true population. Written only when
    N exceeds 1.

  **Breaking (autotel), `trace()` is now deterministic and plain-only.**

  The parameter-name / execution-based heuristic that guessed whether a function
  was a factory has been removed (it executed user code during wrapper
  construction and misclassified functions whose first parameter was named
  `context`). `trace(name?, fn)` now always wraps a PLAIN function that receives
  its real arguments; no context is injected and the function is never inspected.

  - Reach the active span with the new ambient `getActiveTraceContext()`
    (returns the `TraceContext`), `getActiveSpan()`, or a no-arg
    `getRequestLogger()`:
    ```ts
    const getUser = trace('getUser', async (id: string) => {
      getActiveTraceContext()?.setAttribute('user.id', id);
      return db.users.find(id);
    });
    ```
  - The explicit `(ctx) => (...args) => result` factory form moved to
    `withTracing({ name })(factory)` (unchanged behavior; it was always the
    canonical factory API).
  - The "immediate execution" form `trace((ctx) => value)` and `markAsImmediate`
    are removed. Run once and get the value by calling the wrapper: `trace(fn)()`.
  - `traceStep()` is now plain-handler only (`traceStep(cfg)(handler)`); reach the
    step span via `getActiveTraceContext()`.
  - `autotel-edge` gains the same `getActiveTraceContext()` accessor.

  **Breaking (autotel-edge / autotel-cloudflare), same `trace()` redesign.**

  `autotel-edge` had a parallel copy of the same factory heuristic; it is removed
  too, so edge's `trace(name?, fn)` is now plain-only and deterministic. Matching
  `autotel`. The `(ctx) => (...args) => result` factory form moves to
  `withTracing({ name })(factory)`, and the immediate-execution form
  `trace((ctx) => value)` / `markAsImmediate` are gone. Reach the span via the
  ambient `getActiveTraceContext()`. `autotel-cloudflare` re-exports edge's API
  (including `withTracing` and `getActiveTraceContext`), so the same migration
  applies to Workers consumers. As a bonus, `attributesFromResult` now receives
  the resolved (`Awaited`) result, so async functions can annotate it directly.
  Native Cloudflare spans are also available through `getActiveTraceContext()`,
  and wrappers now wait for Promise-returning non-`async` functions before ending
  their span or deriving result attributes.

  **Breaking (autotel, type-level and span names):**

  - Semantic span names now follow current OTel semconv: messaging spans drop the
    system prefix (`kafka.publish orders` → `publish orders`), and
    `traceDB`/`traceHTTP`/`traceMessaging` name spans from semconv
    (`SELECT users`, `GET /users/{id}`) instead of the wrapped function name.
    Dashboards or alerts keyed on the old span names need updating. Legacy and
    stable attribute aliases are emitted side by side.
  - `traceWorkflow`, `traceStep`, `traceDistributedWorkflow`,
    `traceDistributedStep`, `traceProducer`, `traceConsumer`, and
    `ParkingLot.traceCallback` moved their `TArgs`/`TReturn` generics from the
    outer config call onto the returned function so inference finally works.
    Call sites that passed explicit type arguments to the outer call
    (`traceProducer<[Order], void>(cfg)`) now error. Drop the type arguments;
    they are inferred from your factory.
  - `trace('name', () => value)` is now typed as the wrapper it always was at
    runtime (previously mis-typed as immediate execution).

  **Fixed (autotel):**

  - `instrument()` and the factory helpers now accept concretely-typed functions
    under `strict` TypeScript (`strictFunctionTypes`). Previously any typed
    function failed the `InstrumentableFunction` constraint.
  - The `ctx` proxy export is typed as `TraceContext` instead of `{}`.
  - `captureConsole()` now captures the raw argument-array shape Node actually
    publishes on `console.*` diagnostics channels. Real console calls previously
    produced empty log bodies.
  - `customAttributes` hooks on producer/consumer configs accept full OTel
    `Attributes` (optional values included), matching the documented examples.

  **Fixed (other packages):**

  - **autotel-edge**: a service-only `EdgeConfig` (no exporter, no
    spanProcessors) is now a valid type, the runtime always supported it, and
    `parseConfig` warns once when spans have nowhere to export.
  - **autotel-cloudflare**: `instrumentDO`'s generic constraint no longer causes
    multi-minute `tsc` hangs for consumers whose `DurableObjectState` type isn't
    reference-identical to the ambient one.
  - **autotel-mcp-instrumentation**: `extractOtelContextFromMeta` /
    `activateTraceContext` accept the `McpTraceMeta` produced by
    `injectOtelContextToMeta` (the documented round trip now type-checks), and
    `validateToolBudget` accepts custom numeric budgets.
  - **autotel-cli**: the `COMMANDS` manifest entries for the `telemetry` commands
    carry the full `CommandSpec` shape (network/writesFiles/supportsJson etc.).
  - **example-prisma**: migrate the SQLite datasource and client construction to
    Prisma 7's config-file and driver-adapter APIs so client generation and
    example type-checking work again.

  - **autotel**: add an optional `isError` predicate to `trace()`. When it returns
    `false`, the thrown value is treated as expected control flow. The span is
    marked OK, no exception is recorded, and the value is rethrown untouched.
    Backwards-compatible: with no `isError`, every throw is still an error.

  - **autotel-tanstack**: stop recording TanStack Router `redirect()` / `notFound()`
    as span errors. These are throw-based control-flow signals, not application
    errors. The loader, server-function, middleware, and handler wrappers recorded
    them (and reported them to the error store), and marking the span OK inside the
    wrapper wasn't enough. `trace()`'s own rejection handler overwrote it with
    ERROR. All seven trace sites now pass `isError: isRealError`, and a shared
    `isControlFlowSignal` helper recognises both current shapes (`redirect()` throws
    a `Response` with `.options`, `notFound()` throws `{ isNotFound: true }`) and
    the legacy `RedirectError` / `NotFoundError` names.

  - **autotel-telemetry**: drop permanently-rejected outbox batches instead of
    retrying forever. The HTTP drain threw on any non-2xx, so the caller skipped
    `purge()` and the batch stayed buffered; because every run resends the whole
    outbox first, one batch the server permanently rejects silently blocked all
    future telemetry for the tool. The drain now drops permanent 4xx batches and
    still retries on transient failures (408, 425, 429, 5xx, network errors).

  - **autotel** and **autotel-backends**: construct `BatchLogRecordProcessor` /
    `SimpleLogRecordProcessor` with the `{ exporter }` options object required by
    `@opentelemetry/sdk-logs` 0.220 (a positional exporter is silently ignored and
    drops all logs). Affects the PostHog log path, and the Datadog and Grafana
    cloud backends. Also refreshes OpenTelemetry and other dependencies to their
    latest compatible versions.

  - **autotel**: make wrapper APIs easier to use and test. `instrument()` now
    accepts `{ key, fn }` for one function as well as `{ functions }` batches;
    database, HTTP, and messaging semantic helpers accept direct functions;
    helper factories validate malformed callbacks with actionable errors; semantic
    spans use stable names, current attribute aliases, and appropriate span kinds.
    Workflow steps now support `StepContext` factories and context-aware
    compensation. Async root wrappers wait for event and provider flushing before
    settling, and explicit `init({ service })` names retain precedence over
    `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` during NodeSDK resource detection. The trace collector adds
    trace IDs, hierarchy, events, links, kinds, trace-level queries, and
    `expectSpan()`.

  - **autotel-genai**: avoid invoking tracing factories during wrapper
    construction and report malformed factories clearly.

  **Fixed (autotel), sampling key hash distribution.**

  The hash behind `UserIdSampler` and consistent sampling let a shared prefix
  dominate its output. Keys such as `user_1000` through `user_9999` all landed
  between 0.34 and 0.59, so `UserIdSampler` at a 10% rate sampled none of them
  and at 50% sampled far too many. FNV-1a with a murmur3 finalizer replaced it,
  so a configured rate now holds for prefixed keys. The set of users
  `UserIdSampler` selects changes as a result.

  **Changed (autotel), optional resource detectors load synchronously.**

  `initInstrumentation()` loaded the AWS, GCP, and container resource detectors
  with `await import()` inside `try/catch {}`. It now uses `safeRequire`, which
  returns `undefined` when the optional package is absent and rethrows anything
  else. A detector package that is installed but broken now surfaces its error
  instead of being silently skipped. Detection behaviour is unchanged when the
  packages are present or absent.

  **Changed (autotel), `RedactingLogRecordProcessor.onEmit` is typed.**

  The signature was `(logRecord: any, context?: any)` and is now
  `(logRecord: SdkLogRecord, context?: Context)`. The `any` had been hiding a
  real type error in the attribute redaction path.

  **Fixed (autotel-cli), `autotel trace` emitted code that did not parse.**

  The codemod's function-declaration branches dropped the closing paren of the
  `trace(` call, so every `function foo() {}` it rewrote became
  `const foo = trace('foo', function foo() {};` and stopped compiling. Modifiers
  were mishandled too: `async` was prepended to the generated `const`, producing
  `async const`, and `export`/`async` were not stripped before the parameter
  list. Arrow functions and class methods were unaffected.

  The golden fixtures encoded the broken output, so the suite asserted it as
  correct. They are regenerated, and a new test parses every codemod output with
  the TypeScript parser and fails on any diagnostic, which is the check that
  would have caught this.

  **Fixed, broken import paths across docs, skills, and examples.**

  Auditing every documented `autotel/*` import against the package's `exports`
  found four paths that do not exist, all of them copy-pasteable:

  - `autotel/metrics` → `autotel/metric` (migration guide, Datadog guide, both
    the docs site and `docs/`)
  - `autotel/events` → `autotel/event`, in 22 files
  - `autotel/events-adapter` → `autotel/event-subscriber`
  - `autotel/workers` → `autotel-cloudflare`, in the agent skill

  The exported class is `Event`; `Events` never existed, so every
  `new Events(...)` in the subscriber docs and examples would have thrown. Fixed
  in 20 files. `Metrics` was likewise wrong for `Metric`.

  - autotel@5.0.0
  - autotel-edge@4.0.0

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 100cfad: Framework adapter DX overhaul, consolidation, and correctness fixes.

  **New adapters + toolkit (`autotel-adapters`).** Adds NestJS, SvelteKit, and Elysia
  subpaths built on a shared integration toolkit: deferred drain, streaming
  `finishResponse`, `waitUntil` wiring for serverless, and route exclusion that now
  bypasses span creation as well as wide-event emission.

  **One adapter mechanism (breaking).** The parallel per-framework factory/bundle
  layer is removed in favour of the direct handler wrappers, which were always the
  primary API:

  - **Removed** `createNextAdapter`, `createNitroAdapter`, `createCloudflareAdapter`,
    `createExpressAdapter`, `createFastifyAdapter`, `createNestAdapter`,
    `createSvelteKitAdapter`, `createElysiaAdapter`, every `*Toolkit` export
    (`honoToolkit`, `tanstackToolkit`, `nextToolkit`, …), and the underlying
    `createAdapterToolkit` / `createStandardAdapterExports` / `AdapterToolkit`
    helpers from `autotel-adapters/core`.
  - **Use instead** the direct exports — `withAutotel` / `withAutotelFetch` /
    `withAutotelEventHandler` / `autotelMiddleware` / `autotelHandle` /
    `new AutotelInterceptor(options)`, plus `useLogger`. Pass options per call site
    instead of pre-binding through a factory. `createUseLogger` and
    `createRequestRunner` remain for building custom adapters.
  - Migration: replace `const { withAutotel, useLogger } = createNextAdapter(opts)`
    with `import { withAutotel, useLogger } from 'autotel-adapters/next'` and
    `withAutotel(handler, opts)`; replace `honoToolkit.useLogger(c)` /
    `tanstackToolkit.useLogger(ctx)` with the module `useLogger`.

  **Correctness fixes.** `AutotelInterceptor.intercept()` now subscribes to the
  NestJS handler `Observable` inside the trace + request-context scope, proxying
  every value and preserving cancellation — so context propagation, span nesting,
  error capture, status/timing, and streaming semantics all work together (adds
  `rxjs` as an optional peer dependency on the NestJS subpath). Elysia now accepts
  the real context shape.

  **CLI telemetry (`autotel-cli`).** Adds opt-in usage telemetry (bundled into the
  CLI). Consent defaults to **off** — telemetry stays off until the user runs
  `autotel telemetry enable` or sets `AUTOTEL_TELEMETRY=1` — and delivery honours
  async context, rechecks consent, and retains the outbox on failed drains.

  **Devtools (`autotel-devtools`).** Adds a **Clear** button to the "Local data"
  bar that wipes all captured traces, logs, metrics and errors so you can watch
  only new activity, and a relative trace **time-range filter** (`Any time` /
  `Last 5m` / `Last 15m` / `Last 1h`) that is reflected in the shareable URL hash
  (`#range=5m`).

## 0.3.17

### Patch Changes

- 4b7ad78: chore: routine dependency updates

  Refresh runtime and peer dependency ranges across published packages (`ncu`, 3-day release-age cooldown).

  The core `autotel` package moves to the latest OpenTelemetry libraries (stable `2.9.x`, experimental `0.220.x`, semantic-conventions `1.42.x`). This required adapting to a breaking change in `@opentelemetry/sdk-logs`: `BatchLogRecordProcessor` and `SimpleLogRecordProcessor` now take a `{ exporter }` options object instead of a positional exporter argument.

  Notable peer range bumps for consumers: `autotel-aws` (AWS SDK `3.1081`), `autotel-cloudflare` (`@cloudflare/workers-types` v5), `autotel-pact` (`@pact-foundation/pact` v17), `autotel-terminal` (`ai` v7).

### Patch Changes

- ec47ec8: Google Secure AI Agents observability plus MCP protocol-boundary security observability — additive defense-in-depth across planning, tool use, MCP traffic, triage, and UI surfaces.

  **autotel-mcp-instrumentation**
  - Annotation hints captured as `mcp.tool.*` span attributes (`readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`, `openWorldHint`, `untrustedContentHint`) to surface malicious-manifest vectors and tool trust profiles.
  - Payload-size signals (`mcp.tool.arguments.size` / `mcp.tool.result.size`) for token-exhaustion and contaminated-output detection without logging content.
  - Output character budgets (`outputCharBudget` + `MCP_CHAR_BUDGETS`) that emit `mcp.security.budget_exceeded` signals and can bridge to unified `security.*` events.
  - Pluggable injection classifier (`securityClassifier`) scanning arguments and results on both client and server, recording `mcp.security.injection.*` signals and bridging suspicious verdicts to `security.*` events without breaking traced calls.
  - `heuristicInjectionClassifier()` as a dependency-free first-pass detector.
  - `spotlight()` to delimit/base64 untrusted content across Node and edge runtimes.
  - `validateToolBudget()` for WebMCP-style text-surface limits.
  - Guard bridge via `guard` config so MCP tool calls count against an `autotel-genai` guard.
  - `applyManifestAssessment()` bridges suspicious manifest verdicts to unified `security.*` events when `bridgeSecurityEvents` is enabled.
  - New `mcp.security.events` counter and `autotel-mcp-instrumentation/security` subpath export.

  **autotel-cli**
  - Add `autotel security mcp` to aggregate MCP security signals: injection verdicts, output-budget breaches, and untrusted-content tool calls.

  **autotel-genai/agent**
  - `AgentPlanClassifier` + `runAgentPlanClassifier()` / `recordPlanRiskAssessment()` with `agent.plan.risk.*` attrs and optional `llm.plan.risk.elevated` security event.
  - `heuristicPlanRiskClassifier()` as a dependency-free first-pass plan-risk tripwire.
  - Export `agentContextFromSpan()` from the agent subpath.

  **autotel-audit**
  - Passive action-chain processor emits `llm.action_chain.suspicious` and stamps unified `security.*` attributes on the destructive span.
  - `llm.manifest.suspicious` and `llm.plan.risk.elevated` added to the suggested security event catalogue.

  **autotel-cloudflare/agents**
  - `tool:approval` events use `recordHumanApproval()` (optional `autotel-genai` peer dependency).

  **autotel-devtools**
  - Agent timeline surfaces consent, policy, injection, guard, security-event, and plan-step badges from the new agent security attributes.

  **autotel-schema**
  - Agent security contract snapshot extended with `agent.plan.risk.*` attributes.

  **autotel**
  - Core `security-schema` remains the shared sink for unified `security.*` events consumed by the agent and MCP observability layers.

  **Packaging**
  - Drop the duplicated `src/` directory from published tarballs across all packages. The shipped `.js.map` sourcemaps already embed original source via `sourcesContent`, so source-level debugging is unchanged while install footprint shrinks ~20–30%.

## 0.3.11

### Patch Changes

- b77f040: feat(genai): inline guard and streaming telemetry, surfaced in the devtools GenAI tab

  **autotel-genai** gains two subpath exports and two `events` additions:
  - `./guard`: `createGenAiBudget`, `createGenAiGuard`, `parseGuardRules`, and rule factories for cost, token, tool-call, step, and duration ceilings, plus spin-loop, error-loop, and context-window budgets. A stop rule aborts an `AbortSignal` and throws `GEN_AI_GUARD_STOP`. It records `gen_ai.guard.*` events and `gen_ai.session.*` accumulators.
  - `./streaming`: `createStreamTimer`, `computeStreamTiming`, and `recordStreamTiming` for time-to-first-chunk, output throughput, and the inter-chunk gap distribution. Records `gen_ai.response.time_to_first_chunk` plus the `time_to_finish`, `output_tokens_per_second`, and `time_per_output_chunk` extensions.
  - `setGenAiContent` gates input and output capture and base64-encodes binary parts in place of corrupting them through `JSON.stringify`. New `recordModelWarnings` records the `gen_ai.client.warnings` event.

  **autotel-devtools** reads all of it in the GenAI tab:
  - Reads `gen_ai.usage.cost.usd` and shows it in place of the price-table estimate (cost `source: 'reported'`), and counts it in run totals.
  - Reads the streaming attributes and shows a throughput chip with time-to-first-chunk and tokens/sec.
  - Reads `gen_ai.guard.stopped`, the `gen_ai.guard.stop` and `gen_ai.guard.warning` events, and the `gen_ai.session.*` totals. A chip names the rule that fired.
  - Reads the `gen_ai.client.warnings` event and shows a chip with the count. Exports `GenAiStreaming`, `GenAiGuard`, `GenAiSession`, and `GenAiWarning`.

  **fix(skills)**: packages that ship a `skills/` directory now list `skills` in `package.json#files`, so the skill reaches npm and agents discover it from `node_modules`. This covers autotel-genai and twelve other packages: autotel-adapters, autotel-aws, autotel-backends, autotel-cli, autotel-drizzle, autotel-mongoose, autotel-playwright, autotel-plugins, autotel-sentry, autotel-terminal, autotel-vitest, and autotel-web. The `create-autotel-*` contributor skills now point at tsdown instead of tsup and drop the deleted `skills/index.json` step.

  - **Runtime/peer (published packages):** aws-sdk 3.1063, `@tanstack/{react,solid}-start` 1.168.25, hono 4.12.23, `@sentry/node` 10.56, `@cloudflare/workers-types`, react 19.2.7, ai-sdk / ai 6.0.197, `@traceloop/node-server-sdk` 0.27, google-auth-library 10.7, protobufjs 8.6, svelte 5.56.

  **Vite 8:** forced `vite ^8` across the workspace via a pnpm override. autotel was already partly on vite 8 (`@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte` 7 and `@vitejs/plugin-react` 6 both require it); storybook (svelte-vite), the astro docs, and the tanstack-start example all build cleanly on vite 8.

  eslint is held at `^9` in `apps/example-nextjs` (a private example) — `eslint-config-next` 16 / `eslint-plugin-react` are not yet eslint-10 compatible. Published packages are unaffected.

### Patch Changes

- 4ce86fc: Refresh package dependencies across the workspace and keep generated lockfile state in sync.

  Add OTLP/protobuf ingestion support to `autotel-devtools` for traces, logs, and metrics. The devtools HTTP receiver now accepts both OTLP/JSON and OTLP/protobuf payloads on the existing `/v1/traces`, `/v1/logs`, and `/v1/metrics` endpoints, decodes protobuf payloads with embedded OTLP schemas, and includes interop coverage using the OpenTelemetry protobuf serializers.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 30a485b: ### autotel-web — W3C baggage propagation

  Add end-to-end business-context propagation via W3C baggage.

  New `setBaggage(record)` / `clearBaggage(key?)` runtime API and an `init({ baggage: { initial, allowedOrigins } })` config option let you attach context such as `tenant.id` that travels with every instrumented request as a W3C `baggage` header and is tagged onto every browser-recorded span. On the backend, autotel's `BaggageSpanProcessor` copies the entries onto server spans, so a single attribute (e.g. `tenant.id`) appears on browser and server spans across the whole trace — no more reading the tenant from request URLs in devtools.

  `setBaggage()` merges additively (matching Sentry `setTags` / Datadog `setGlobalContextProperty` ergonomics) and works for values known only at runtime (post-login, tenant switcher). Baggage injection is **fail-closed**: it is sent only to same-origin requests unless a destination is listed in `baggage.allowedOrigins`, and never travels wider than `traceparent` (inherits DNT/GPC/blocked-origin suppression), so customer-identifying values are not leaked to third-party origins. Covers both `fetch` and `XMLHttpRequest`.

  ### autotel-adapters — Express, Fastify, auto-emit

  Add Express and Fastify adapters and emit one canonical wide event per request by default across all adapters.

  `autotel-adapters/express` and `autotel-adapters/fastify` expose `withAutotel(handler, options)` and `useLogger(request)`, matching the existing Next, Nitro, and Cloudflare adapters. Each request opens a span, gets a request-scoped logger, and emits one canonical wide event when the handler settles.

  ```typescript
  import { withAutotel, useLogger } from 'autotel-adapters/express';

  app.get(
    '/orders',
    withAutotel((req, res) => {
      useLogger(req).set({ feature: 'checkout' });
      res.json({ ok: true });
    }),
  );
  ```

  The Express wrapper records thrown errors and forwards them to `next`; the Fastify wrapper records and rethrows for Fastify's error handling.

  **Behavior change:** `autoEmit` now defaults to `true` for every adapter, including the existing Next, Nitro, and Cloudflare wrappers. Each wrapped handler emits one wide event per request. Pass `{ autoEmit: false }` to restore the previous behavior of not emitting automatically.

  ### autotel — PII redaction, catalogs, LLM cost

  **Auto-enable PII redaction in production.** When `attributeRedactor` is left unset and the resolved environment is `production` (`config.environment` or `NODE_ENV`), `init()` now applies the `'default'` redaction preset. Span attributes are scrubbed of emails, phones, SSNs, credit cards, and sensitive keys before any exporter sees them. In non-production environments redaction stays off so local debugging shows real values.

  **Behavior change:** production telemetry that previously exported raw values now has PII redacted by default. Control it:
  - `init({ attributeRedactor: 'strict' })` — stronger preset, applied in every environment.
  - `init({ attributeRedactor: false })` — disable redaction entirely, even in production.
  - `AUTOTEL_REDACT_PII` env var — `off` disables, `default` / `strict` / `pci-dss` selects a preset, `on` forces the default preset on in any environment.

  Precedence: explicit config, then env var, then the production default. The `attributeRedactor` config field now also accepts `false`.

  **Typed error and audit catalogs:** `defineErrorCatalog()` and `defineAuditCatalog()`.

  Group related errors into one catalog and get a refactor-safe builder per code, with autocomplete at every call site and typed message parameters. Each builder produces a `StructuredError` carrying the entry's `message`, `status`, `code`, `why`, `fix`, and `link`; codes default to `${namespace}.${KEY}`.

  ```typescript
  import { defineErrorCatalog } from 'autotel';

  const billing = defineErrorCatalog('billing', {
    PAYMENT_DECLINED: {
      status: 402,
      message: 'Card declined',
      why: '...',
      fix: '...',
    },
    INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS: {
      status: 402,
      message: ({
        available,
        required,
      }: {
        available: number;
        required: number;
      }) => `Insufficient funds: $${available} of $${required}`,
    },
  });

  throw billing.PAYMENT_DECLINED({ cause: stripeError });
  throw billing.INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS({ available: 5, required: 100 });

  if (billing.PAYMENT_DECLINED.match(err)) {
    /* ... */
  }
  ```

  `defineAuditCatalog()` produces typed audit-action descriptors (`action`, `severity`, optional `message`). Helpers `isCatalogError()` and `getCatalogCode()` read the catalog code off any error.

  **Per-model LLM cost estimation:** `estimateLLMCost()`, `recordLLMCost()`, and a `MODEL_PRICING` table.

  Estimate the USD cost of an LLM call from its token usage and record it as the `gen_ai.usage.cost.usd` span attribute, pairing with the existing `gen_ai.client.cost.usd` metric bucket advice.

  ```typescript
  import { trace, recordLLMCost } from 'autotel';

  export const chat = trace((ctx) => async (prompt: string) => {
    const res = await client.messages.create({ model /* ... */ });
    recordLLMCost(ctx, model, {
      inputTokens: res.usage.input_tokens,
      outputTokens: res.usage.output_tokens,
    });
    return res;
  });
  ```

  `MODEL_PRICING` ships approximate public list prices for common OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini models; override or extend per call via `{ pricing }`. Versioned model ids resolve to a base entry by longest-prefix match, and cached input tokens are billed at `cachedInputPer1M` when provided.

  ### autotel-devtools — HTTP read-back and dual-stack loopback
  - **`GET /v1/traces`** returns the traces the receiver has actually captured (`{ traces, count }`), and **`DELETE /v1/traces`** clears captured telemetry. This lets integration/Playwright tests verify the collector _received_ spans by polling it over HTTP — instead of only asserting "the client tried to send", which a browser-level route intercept can fulfil before the request ever reaches a server.
  - **Dual-stack loopback:** when bound to a loopback host, the CLI and `createDevtools()` now listen on **both** `127.0.0.1` and `::1`, so a client connecting via `localhost` reaches the receiver regardless of how the OS resolves `localhost` (macOS prefers IPv6 `::1`). This removes a silent footgun where a dev-server proxy targeting `localhost` saw its spans vanish with no error against an IPv4-only receiver.
  - **Startup self-check:** the CLI prints every bound address, a `curl .../v1/traces` verification hint, and a warning (not a silent failure) if a loopback family can't be bound.
  - New README sections: "Behind a dev-server proxy" (the `pathRewrite` + `127.0.0.1` gotchas) and "Verifying ingestion in tests".

  ### autotel-subscribers — FileSubscriber

  Add `FileSubscriber` (`autotel-subscribers/file`): append tracked events to a file as newline-delimited JSON (NDJSON).

  Useful for AI agents, scripts, evals, and local debugging that want structured events on disk without a hosted backend. Query the file with `jq`, load it into a notebook, or feed it to an agent.

  ```typescript
  import { Event } from 'autotel/events';
  import { FileSubscriber } from 'autotel-subscribers/file';

  const events = new Event('worker', {
    subscribers: [new FileSubscriber({ path: './telemetry/events.ndjson' })],
  });
  ```

  Writes are serialized so concurrent events never interleave. Options: `pretty` for indented JSON, `mkdir` to create parent directories (default on), and `transform` to reshape or drop events before writing.

  ### autotel-terminal — dual-stack loopback

  Bind both loopback families and warn on partial binding.

  When bound to a loopback host, the receiver now listens on **both** `127.0.0.1` and `::1`, so a client (or dev-server proxy) connecting via `localhost` reaches it regardless of how the OS resolves `localhost` (macOS prefers IPv6 `::1`). Previously the CLI bound IPv4-only, so a `localhost` proxy could silently send spans into a black hole. The startup line now prints every bound address and warns (rather than failing silently) if a loopback family can't be bound. Added a README "Behind a dev-server proxy" section documenting the `pathRewrite` + `127.0.0.1` gotchas.

### Patch Changes

- 5e146a7: Streamline package surface and align skills with the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification).
  - Drop `@tanstack/intent` from runtime and dev dependencies, plus the auto-generated `bin/intent.js` shims. Skills still ship under each package's `skills/` directory and are discovered by spec-compliant agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, etc.) via filesystem scan — no consumer-side CLI required.
  - Remove the `autotel/workers` and `autotel/cloudflare` entry points from `autotel`. Cloudflare Workers users should import directly from `autotel-cloudflare` (and its `/logger`, `/sampling`, `/events` subpaths). `autotel` no longer peer-depends on `autotel-cloudflare` or `autotel-edge`.
  - Strip non-spec frontmatter (`type`, `library`, `library_version`, `sources`, `requires`) from all `SKILL.md` files; keep only spec-defined fields (`name`, `description`, optional `license`).
  - Move user-facing skills (`migrate-to-autotel`, `tune-sampling`, `debug-missing-spans`, `build-audit-trails`) into `packages/autotel/skills/` so consumers receive them automatically via npm. Contributor-only skills (`create-autotel-adapter`, `create-autotel-instrumentation`, `create-autotel-exporter`) remain under the repo-root `skills/` directory.
  - Realign `autotel`'s peer dependency ranges to match published versions on npm.
  - Release workflow now refreshes `pnpm-lock.yaml` after `changeset version` so the next Version Packages PR ships with a consistent lockfile.

### Patch Changes

- 7d77567: Add opt-in OTLP log export and improve terminal UX.

  **autotel**
  - Add `logs: true` option to `init()` that auto-configures `BatchLogRecordProcessor` + `OTLPLogExporter` from the endpoint — no manual imports needed. Defaults to `false` (opt-in) to preserve existing behavior and upstream `OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER` handling.
  - Add `resolveLogsFlag()` with `AUTOTEL_LOGS` env var override, matching the `metrics` pattern.
  - Move `@opentelemetry/exporter-logs-otlp-http` and `@opentelemetry/sdk-logs` from optional peer deps to regular dependencies.
  - Export `RedactingLogRecordProcessor` from `posthog-logs.ts` for reuse by the auto-configured log pipeline.

  **autotel-terminal**
  - AI panel: show configuration guidance when no provider is detected; only enter input mode when a provider is available.
  - AI panel: Escape now closes the panel entirely (not just exits input mode).
  - Add `f` key for typeable traceId filter with Tab autocomplete against known trace IDs.
  - Add Tab-to-traceId autocomplete in `/` search mode (4+ character prefix match).
  - Add Escape to exit search mode (in addition to existing `/` toggle and Enter).
