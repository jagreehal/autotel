### Minor Changes

- 7a2f38c: Server-side querying, a durable store, and a shared time window.

  **Breaking.** `MetricData`, `DevtoolsServer.addMetric()` and `maxMetricCount`
  are removed, `DevtoolsData` no longer carries a `metrics` field, and snapshots
  no longer contain a `metrics` section. Nothing in the repo called `addMetric` and
  nothing produced a `MetricData`, so the practical blast radius is small —
  `TraceData` and `SpanAttributes` are unchanged, which is what the VS Code
  extension's backend adapters map onto, and `createDevtools()` keeps working with
  no new options because the store defaults to in-memory.

  **Query language.** A telemetry query language with a hand-written tokenizer,
  recursive-descent parser and SQL compiler: `service = api AND duration > 100`,
  `name CONTAINS checkout`, `http.status_code = 500`, `service IN [api, web]`,
  `name REGEXP "^GET "`, `parent = NULL`, parentheses, `AND`/`OR`, quoted field
  names for attribute keys a bare word cannot spell, and bare words as free text.
  Any field not declared as a column is looked up as a span attribute, so every
  attribute a service emits is queryable without being declared.

  Values always become bound parameters and identifiers always come from a schema,
  so no user-supplied text reaches the SQL string.

  **Durable store.** `DevtoolsStore` over `node:sqlite` — in the standard library
  on Node 24, which this package already required, so persistence costs no new
  dependency. Traces and spans with indexes, keyset pagination, a registered
  `REGEXP` function, and count-capped retention that prunes spans with their
  traces. `createDevtools()` accepts `dbPath` and `maxTraces`; both default to
  in-memory, so existing embedders keep their current behaviour and gain querying
  and paging.

  **`POST /api/query/traces`**, behind the same origin guard as the other
  read-back routes. A malformed query is a 400 with positioned errors rather than
  a 500, so the editor can point at the problem.

  **Shared time window.** One window across tabs, URL-serializable, with presets
  and a custom range. Presets are stored as intents so "Last 15m" keeps tracking
  now instead of freezing when it was clicked. "All" means no choice was made,
  which is what lets a view fit its own data without cropping a window the user
  actually asked for.

  **Live tail with freeze.** The trace list follows new data by default and
  freezes the moment you type a query, scroll back, select a row or bound the
  window — counting new matches in a pill instead of reordering rows underneath
  you. Freezing is a consequence of what you did, not a mode to manage.

  **bits-ui** for overlay primitives, with a portal container inside the widget's
  shadow root so popovers never render into the host page.

  **Metrics.** The tab is rebuilt on real OTel metric streams. The
  `event | funnel | outcome | value` model it used to render is **removed**:
  nothing ever produced it — `addMetric()` had no callers anywhere and
  `POST /v1/metrics` fed only the Agents tab — so the tab could never display
  anything. `MetricData`, `DevtoolsServer.addMetric()`, `metricsSignal`,
  `groupedMetricsSignal` and `maxMetricCount` are gone, and snapshots no longer
  carry a `metrics` section.

  In their place: a metric catalogue with sparklines, a multi-series time chart
  with axes and an isolating legend, a histogram bucket distribution with
  interpolated p50/p90/p99, and **clickable exemplars** that open the trace behind
  a spike. Cumulative counters are differenced into rates before drawing, with a
  counter reset read as an increment from zero rather than a negative spike that
  never happened. Long series are downsampled keeping their extremes, so an
  outlier is never smoothed away.

  **Logs.** The Logs tab reads from the store with the same query bar, window and
  freeze behaviour. Severity is queryable as text _or_ number, so "error and
  above" is `severity_number >= 17` rather than a fixed dropdown option. A
  structured body is stored as structure as well as text, so it never degrades to
  `[object Object]` — the text is what free-text search matches, since it is what
  the row displays.

  **Two browser bundles.** The embedded widget and the full-page viewer now build
  separately from one entry and one component library, differing only in which
  view registry is bundled. Embedded ships traces, logs, errors and resources —
  it is a guest in someone else's product page, and every kilobyte is one their
  users download. The exploratory tabs and the chart and graph code they pull in
  go to the full viewer. `GET /widget.js` serves the reduced bundle;
  `?mode=fullpage` serves the full one.

      embedded   472 KB (gzip 138 KB)
      full page  630 KB (gzip 188 KB)

  The embedded bundle is smaller than it was before any of this, despite gaining
  the query language, server-side querying, the time window, live-tail freeze,
  paging and the waterfall tree gutter.

  **Waterfall.** Connector lines in the gutter show which parent a span belongs
  to, which indentation alone stops conveying past two or three levels.

  **Paging.** Both list views fetch the next page as you scroll, and rows use
  `content-visibility` rather than a virtualised list — the browser skips what is
  offscreen while the rows stay real DOM, so find-in-page, text selection and
  screen readers keep working.

  **Also breaking.** The Traces-only time-range dropdown (`AUTOTEL`'s
  `traceTimeRangeFilterSignal`, the `range` URL parameter, and the
  `TraceTimeRangeFilter` type) is removed. It was superseded by the global time
  window, and leaving both meant the Traces tab carried two controls for the same
  thing. The shareable URL now carries `window` instead.

  **Derived views read the store.** Service Map, Flow, Security, Resources, GenAI
  and Errors folded over the live tail — the last hundred traces the process
  happened to receive — so they described a few minutes regardless of what the
  toolbar said, and lost everything on restart. They now fold over a store-backed
  working set for the chosen window.

  Errors get `POST /api/query/errors`, which re-runs the existing aggregator over
  stored traces rather than adding a second implementation, so the grouping and
  fingerprinting rules are the ones the live path already uses. The Errors tab can
  now answer "what was failing an hour ago", which it previously could not.

  If the server is unreachable the views fall back to the live tail rather than
  blanking — showing the traces already in the browser beats showing nothing.

  **Compare, Coverage and Copy as curl.** Compare
  (`POST /api/analysis/compare`) answers "what is different about the ones that
  broke" by borrowing `compareCohorts` from `autotel/analysis`, and carries the
  mark-and-compare loop: mark a moment, change something, compare after against
  before. `autotel` is a peer dependency, so the import is lazy and its absence is
  a 501 with an install hint rather than a server that will not start. Coverage
  (`GET /api/coverage`) joins `autotel map`'s record of every entry point against
  what the store has seen and lists what has emitted nothing, linked into the
  editor; a missing map is a 404 with instructions, not an empty report that would
  read as full coverage. Copy as curl rebuilds a request from an HTTP span,
  reading both the pre-1.0 and current semconv attribute names. Compare and
  Coverage are full-page only; the embedded widget stays lean.

  **Links, history and clocks.** Deep links carry the trace's own bounds plus a
  minute of air, so a link handed to a human opens on a window that still contains
  the trace, and each slowest span carries a link that selects that span. The
  widget pushes history for a change of tab, trace or span and replaces for a
  window, sort or query keystroke, so Back retraces and typing cannot bury the
  page you came from. Every clock routes through one formatter with a Local/UTC
  control persisted per viewer rather than in the URL — a shared link should open
  on the sender's window, not their timezone.

  **Loopback.** A loopback bind creates two listeners because localhost resolves
  to `::1` on macOS and `127.0.0.1` elsewhere; only the primary got the
  WebSocket, so a client reaching the sibling read telemetry over HTTP while its
  live tail never connected. Both listeners now share one WebSocket server, one
  client set and one broadcast, with the path check and origin guard inside the
  upgrade handler. `createDevtools()` also exposes `ready`, carrying the port
  actually bound — which with `port: 0` or a busy port is not the one requested.

  **Contract violations reach the viewer** (`autotel-schema`). A
  `TelemetryContract` is a TypeScript module in the service's own repo, so the app
  is the only thing that can validate against it and a viewer reading exported
  spans never can. The schema processor now stamps the validation result onto the
  span as attributes and devtools reads them, rather than devtools growing a
  dependency and a way to load someone else's contract. The stamp is opt-in: a
  conforming span stays unmarked so the presence of the attribute is what a reader
  filters on, the severity is the worst seen rather than the last, and the code
  list is capped at 20 while the count stays exact.

  **MCP pushdown** (`autotel-mcp`). The `devtools` backend now pushes queries down
  to the devtools store. `searchTraces` compiles a structured `TraceSearchQuery`
  into devtools query-language text and runs it server-side as SQL over the whole
  retained history, instead of fetching the hundred-trace live tail and filtering
  it in JavaScript. The compiler covers the full `QueryFilter` operator set —
  `in`/`not_in` as arrays, `between` as a pair of bounds, `exists`/`not_exists` as
  NULL tests, and the comparison and text operators directly. Metrics are served
  too, so the backend declares `metrics: 'available'` rather than `'unsupported'`.
  `autotel diagnose`, `autotel query` and the MCP tools now read the same local
  telemetry the viewer shows.

  Both remain compatible with an older devtools: each call falls back to the
  read-back API when the query endpoint is absent, and the probe is cached so a
  legacy server costs one failed request per process rather than one per query.
  The query path checks the response _shape_ rather than only its status — it
  returns results as already filtered, so a bare 200 from anything on that URL
  would otherwise present unfiltered traces as query matches.

  `autotel-devtools` gains a `./query` export (`parse`, `compileWhere`, the
  operator table) so query generators can verify what they emit against the real
  grammar rather than a copy of it.

  ## `autotel-webmcp` (new package)

  Add `autotel-webmcp`: OpenTelemetry instrumentation for WebMCP tools in the browser.

  The browser-side counterpart to `autotel-mcp-instrumentation`. `instrumentWebMCP()`
  wraps the browser's shared ModelContext so every imperative tool registration and
  agent invocation becomes a span, including calls made through retained aliases.

  Spans record what the agent actually received rather than what the handler
  returned — the browser serialises results, substitutes a message for empty ones,
  and silently discards unrecognised annotations. `webmcp.annotations.dropped` and
  `webmcp.result.envelope` surface two failures that are otherwise invisible at
  runtime. Payload content is privacy-safe by default (opt-in), while payload size
  and result-shape signals are always recorded. Two entry points: `autotel-webmcp`
  fills in autotel-web's `span()`, and `autotel-webmcp/core` is the same
  instrumentation with no telemetry dependency for when spans already have
  somewhere to go or the browser SDK should stay out of the bundle. Shared concepts use canonical
  `gen_ai.*` and `mcp.*` attributes alongside WebMCP-specific facts.

  ## `autotel-web`

  Stop the exporter tracing its own requests, and accept a bare origin in `initFull`.

  `FetchInstrumentation` and `XMLHttpRequestInstrumentation` were constructed with
  no `ignoreUrls`, so the OTLP exporter's own POST to the collector was traced.
  Each export produced a span, which was exported, which produced another span —
  a feedback loop that floods the collector and starves real spans out of the
  batch buffer. Both instrumentations now ignore the configured OTLP endpoint.

  `init()` appended `/v1/traces` to the configured `endpoint` but `initFull()`
  passed it straight to the exporter, so the same config value meant two
  different things and a bare origin silently 404'd in full mode. Both now share
  `normaliseOtlpEndpoint()`.

  ## `autotel`

  Awaitable return values are now typed by what they resolve to. `trace()`,
  `span()` and `instrument()` gained leading `PromiseLike` overloads, so a
  function returning an ORM query builder (drizzle, knex, Prisma, Sequelize)
  is typed as `Promise<T>` rather than as the builder itself. `instrument({
functions })` returns `InstrumentedFunctions<T>`, which maps each awaitable
  member to `Promise<Awaited<...>>` while leaving synchronous members alone.

  At runtime the same distinction is now honoured: `promiseFromThenable()`
  replaces the `instanceof Promise` checks. A lazy thenable was previously read
  as a synchronous value, which ended the span before the work ran and left its
  real children orphaned outside a short parent span. Promises from another
  realm failed the same check.

  ## `autotel-drizzle`

  `spanNaming` chooses how query spans are named. The default, `'drizzle'`,
  keeps the `drizzle.select` names existing dashboards are built on;
  `'semconv'` follows OpenTelemetry's database convention,
  `{db.operation.name} {target}` — `SELECT comments` — which groups by table
  for free in any OTel-native UI.

  ## `autotel-posthog`

  `FeatureFlagOptions`, `PersonProperties` and `groupIdentify()` now describe
  their property bags as `Record<string, unknown>` instead of
  `Record<string, any>`. Reading a nested value off one of these now needs a
  narrowing step it always should have had.

  ## Experiments, buckets, and the trace you cannot afford to lose

  **`experiment({ name, variant, expect })`** stamps `experiment.name`,
  `experiment.variant` and `experiment.expectation` on the active span, and writes
  the first two to baggage so child spans and downstream services carry the same
  answer. An experiment covers a request, not one function in it. An
  experiment needs a guess and a way to check it; instrumentation was already the
  check, and nothing recorded the guess. The two cohorts you want to compare are
  now selectable from the telemetry rather than reconstructed by hand from deploy
  timestamps, and the expectation travels with them, so a reader a month later
  sees the claim next to the result. Ambient, so it reaches the span from a helper
  several frames inside a traced body, and it no-ops when nothing is being traced.

  **`bucket(value, boundaries)`** from `autotel/analysis` turns a raw duration or
  byte count into a low-cardinality label. `compareCohorts` skips fields whose
  values never repeat, which is what a raw number does, so the docs already told
  you to bucket at instrumentation time and shipped nothing to do it. A non-finite
  value and an empty boundary list both give `'unknown'`: filing a NaN duration
  under the slowest bucket would invent a cohort that never happened. An unordered
  boundary list is sorted rather than producing overlapping labels.

  **`forceKeep()`** keeps a trace whatever the sampler decides, for a payment, an
  audit-relevant action, or a request you are debugging right now.

  **Debug capture through baggage.** A request carrying `autotel.debug` keeps its
  trace whatever the sampler decides, and because baggage is a wire format it
  follows that request into every service behind the first one. Set it at a
  gateway, from a feature flag, or with `curl -H 'baggage: autotel.debug=1'`.
  Nothing is deployed to turn it on, which is the difference between this and
  `forceKeep()`. `AUTOTEL_DEBUG_BAGGAGE_KEY` is exported for callers who would
  rather not spell the key.

  **Fixed:** `forceKeepAuditEvent()` in `autotel-audit` did not survive tail
  sampling. It set the tail-keep attributes from inside the traced body, and the
  tracing wrapper writes the sampler's verdict once the body has returned, so a
  sampler that decided to drop overwrote the override and the audit event was
  discarded. `forceKeep()` marks the span as claimed and the wrapper now leaves a
  claimed span alone; `forceKeepAuditEvent()` delegates to it.

### Patch Changes

- ebcd606: Trace each query once, and record what the database did with it.

  **One span per query.** drizzle layers a database object over a session and both
  expose an entry point for the same round trip, so every query was traced twice:
  once properly, and once as a blank `drizzle.query` span carrying no SQL and no
  operation. One `db.execute()` produced 2 spans and a transaction with a single
  statement produced 4. The lower layer now claims the query.

  **Query plans.** `explain: 'plan' | 'analyze'` puts the postgres planner's answer
  on the span, so a trace shows what the database did and not only what it was
  asked for. Add an index and `db.statement` is unchanged, byte for byte, with the
  same `db.statement.hash`; the duration moves and nothing says why. The same query
  either side of a `CREATE INDEX`:

  |                         | before             | after                  |
  | ----------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
  | `db.statement.hash`     | `372269a8881e921a` | `372269a8881e921a`     |
  | `db.plan.hash`          | `0b50591ce9f68f51` | `eb8765b8d1c4af5a`     |
  | `db.plan.node`          | `Seq Scan`         | `Bitmap Heap Scan`     |
  | `db.plan.indexes`       |                    | `idx_comments_post_id` |
  | `db.plan.rows_examined` | `200199`           | `1001`                 |
  | `db.plan.blocks`        | `1861`             | `1005`                 |

  An unchanged statement hash beside a changed plan hash is a planner decision.
  Off by default: both modes add a round trip, and `'analyze'` executes the
  statement again to measure it, so it runs on read-only statements only and a
  traced insert never runs twice.

  **Transaction spans.** `drizzle.transaction` wraps the whole callback, so it
  measures how long the transaction held its connection and its locks, including
  the time your code spent between statements. Turn it off with
  `traceTransactions: false`.

  **Table names.** `db.collection.name` carries the table, read from the SQL so raw
  `db.execute` groups alongside query-builder calls.

  **Current attribute names.** `semconv` selects `'legacy'`, `'stable'`, or
  `'dup'`, and follows `OTEL_SEMCONV_STABILITY_OPT_IN` when unset. The default
  stays legacy, so existing dashboards keep working.

  **Tracer injection.** `tracerProvider` sends this client's spans to a provider
  of your own rather than the globally registered one.

  **mysql and sqlite.** mysql spans reported no table, because the pattern only
  understood double-quoted identifiers and mysql quotes with backticks.
  better-sqlite3 and bun-sqlite traced one query as two spans, because their
  prepared query answers `all()` by calling `this.values()` on itself. Verified
  across node-postgres, postgres.js, pglite, mysql2, better-sqlite3, and libsql,
  each driven through the query builder, the relational API, and raw
  `db.execute`.

### Patch Changes

- 0f518c6: Refresh dependencies to their latest minor and patch releases, most notably the
  OpenTelemetry SDK (`0.220.x` → `0.221.x`, `2.9.x` → `2.10.x`).

  Majors are deliberately held back for a separate change, including TypeScript 7,
  pnpm 11, chalk 6, jsdom 30 and the ESLint toolchain.

- 0f518c6: Stop publishing source maps. Every package is roughly half the size it was.

  Published output across all packages drops from 18.7 MiB to 7.9 MiB. Installing
  `autotel` downloads 500 KiB gzipped instead of 1,130 KiB. Nothing about the
  shipped JavaScript or type declarations changed.

  Source maps were 55–65% of every package, because each source byte was emitted
  four times: once as ESM, once as CJS, and again inside each format's map, which
  embedded `sourcesContent`. They never reached a consumer's application bundle —
  bundlers read maps and discard them — so the cost was pure install weight in
  exchange for TypeScript stack traces under `node --enable-source-maps`.

  Best-in-class TypeScript libraries do not make that trade. Of fourteen surveyed,
  twelve publish no maps at all (zod, hono, pino, fastify, vitest, vite, rollup,
  undici, commander, tsdown, react, astro), and not one publishes `.d.ts.map`.
  The OpenTelemetry packages do ship maps at around 50% of their size, which is
  the convention this repo had been following.

  The `.d.ts.map` declaration maps were broken regardless: `sourcesContent: false`
  with sources pointing at `../src/*.ts`, which `files` never published, so they
  resolved to nothing on a consumer's machine.

  Maps are still generated for local development. `tsconfig.json` keeps
  `sourceMap` and `declarationMap` on; only `tsconfig.build.json` disables them,
  so debugging the workspace is unchanged.

  This also fixes the bundle-size gate, which had been amplifying every ordinary
  change by 4×. The three packages that were failing it (`autotel-backends` +43.9%,
  `autotel-mcp` +14.4%, `autotel-schema` +12.0%) were not bloated — that growth was
  legitimate new backend code, quadrupled by the build. The baseline is
  regenerated.

- ec47ec8: Google Secure AI Agents observability plus MCP protocol-boundary security observability — additive defense-in-depth across planning, tool use, MCP traffic, triage, and UI surfaces.

  **autotel-mcp-instrumentation**
  - Annotation hints captured as `mcp.tool.*` span attributes (`readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`, `openWorldHint`, `untrustedContentHint`) to surface malicious-manifest vectors and tool trust profiles.
  - Payload-size signals (`mcp.tool.arguments.size` / `mcp.tool.result.size`) for token-exhaustion and contaminated-output detection without logging content.
  - Output character budgets (`outputCharBudget` + `MCP_CHAR_BUDGETS`) that emit `mcp.security.budget_exceeded` signals and can bridge to unified `security.*` events.
  - Pluggable injection classifier (`securityClassifier`) scanning arguments and results on both client and server, recording `mcp.security.injection.*` signals and bridging suspicious verdicts to `security.*` events without breaking traced calls.
  - `heuristicInjectionClassifier()` as a dependency-free first-pass detector.
  - `spotlight()` to delimit/base64 untrusted content across Node and edge runtimes.
  - `validateToolBudget()` for WebMCP-style text-surface limits.
  - Guard bridge via `guard` config so MCP tool calls count against an `autotel-genai` guard.
  - `applyManifestAssessment()` bridges suspicious manifest verdicts to unified `security.*` events when `bridgeSecurityEvents` is enabled.
  - New `mcp.security.events` counter and `autotel-mcp-instrumentation/security` subpath export.

  **autotel-cli**
  - Add `autotel security mcp` to aggregate MCP security signals: injection verdicts, output-budget breaches, and untrusted-content tool calls.

  **autotel-genai/agent**
  - `AgentPlanClassifier` + `runAgentPlanClassifier()` / `recordPlanRiskAssessment()` with `agent.plan.risk.*` attrs and optional `llm.plan.risk.elevated` security event.
  - `heuristicPlanRiskClassifier()` as a dependency-free first-pass plan-risk tripwire.
  - Export `agentContextFromSpan()` from the agent subpath.

  **autotel-audit**
  - Passive action-chain processor emits `llm.action_chain.suspicious` and stamps unified `security.*` attributes on the destructive span.
  - `llm.manifest.suspicious` and `llm.plan.risk.elevated` added to the suggested security event catalogue.

  **autotel-cloudflare/agents**
  - `tool:approval` events use `recordHumanApproval()` (optional `autotel-genai` peer dependency).

  **autotel-devtools**
  - Agent timeline surfaces consent, policy, injection, guard, security-event, and plan-step badges from the new agent security attributes.

  **autotel-schema**
  - Agent security contract snapshot extended with `agent.plan.risk.*` attributes.

  **autotel**
  - Core `security-schema` remains the shared sink for unified `security.*` events consumed by the agent and MCP observability layers.

  **Packaging**
  - Drop the duplicated `src/` directory from published tarballs across all packages. The shipped `.js.map` sourcemaps already embed original source via `sourcesContent`, so source-level debugging is unchanged while install footprint shrinks ~20–30%.

- b77f040: feat(genai): inline guard and streaming telemetry, surfaced in the devtools GenAI tab

  **autotel-genai** gains two subpath exports and two `events` additions:
  - `./guard`: `createGenAiBudget`, `createGenAiGuard`, `parseGuardRules`, and rule factories for cost, token, tool-call, step, and duration ceilings, plus spin-loop, error-loop, and context-window budgets. A stop rule aborts an `AbortSignal` and throws `GEN_AI_GUARD_STOP`. It records `gen_ai.guard.*` events and `gen_ai.session.*` accumulators.
  - `./streaming`: `createStreamTimer`, `computeStreamTiming`, and `recordStreamTiming` for time-to-first-chunk, output throughput, and the inter-chunk gap distribution. Records `gen_ai.response.time_to_first_chunk` plus the `time_to_finish`, `output_tokens_per_second`, and `time_per_output_chunk` extensions.
  - `setGenAiContent` gates input and output capture and base64-encodes binary parts in place of corrupting them through `JSON.stringify`. New `recordModelWarnings` records the `gen_ai.client.warnings` event.

  **autotel-devtools** reads all of it in the GenAI tab:
  - Reads `gen_ai.usage.cost.usd` and shows it in place of the price-table estimate (cost `source: 'reported'`), and counts it in run totals.
  - Reads the streaming attributes and shows a throughput chip with time-to-first-chunk and tokens/sec.
  - Reads `gen_ai.guard.stopped`, the `gen_ai.guard.stop` and `gen_ai.guard.warning` events, and the `gen_ai.session.*` totals. A chip names the rule that fired.
  - Reads the `gen_ai.client.warnings` event and shows a chip with the count. Exports `GenAiStreaming`, `GenAiGuard`, `GenAiSession`, and `GenAiWarning`.

  **fix(skills)**: packages that ship a `skills/` directory now list `skills` in `package.json#files`, so the skill reaches npm and agents discover it from `node_modules`. This covers autotel-genai and twelve other packages: autotel-adapters, autotel-aws, autotel-backends, autotel-cli, autotel-drizzle, autotel-mongoose, autotel-playwright, autotel-plugins, autotel-sentry, autotel-terminal, autotel-vitest, and autotel-web. The `create-autotel-*` contributor skills now point at tsdown instead of tsup and drop the deleted `skills/index.json` step.

- 4ce86fc: Refresh package dependencies across the workspace and keep generated lockfile state in sync.

  Add OTLP/protobuf ingestion support to `autotel-devtools` for traces, logs, and metrics. The devtools HTTP receiver now accepts both OTLP/JSON and OTLP/protobuf payloads on the existing `/v1/traces`, `/v1/logs`, and `/v1/metrics` endpoints, decodes protobuf payloads with embedded OTLP schemas, and includes interop coverage using the OpenTelemetry protobuf serializers.

### Patch Changes

- 8d5d84d: Clarify edge vs Node entry points and tighten Cloudflare logger packaging.
  - **`autotel-cloudflare`**: Move `autotel-edge` to a required peer dependency (devDependency for this package’s tests) so Workers apps declare the edge foundation explicitly. Import execution-logger helpers from `autotel-edge/logger` instead of the root export. Document a logs-only quickstart via `autotel-cloudflare/logger`, a `nodejs_compat` compatibility matrix per subpath, and cross-links to related packages.
  - **`autotel-edge`**: Re-export `TraceContext` from `autotel-edge/logger` for execution-logger consumers. Add See also links in the README.
  - **`autotel-drizzle`**: Document Drizzle `>= 0.45.2` peer requirement, Node-only scope, and D1-on-Workers guidance via `autotel-cloudflare/bindings`. Add See also links.
  - **`autotel`**: Add an entry-point map (Node vs Cloudflare vs edge) and See also links in the README.

### Patch Changes

- 5e146a7: Streamline package surface and align skills with the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification).
  - Drop `@tanstack/intent` from runtime and dev dependencies, plus the auto-generated `bin/intent.js` shims. Skills still ship under each package's `skills/` directory and are discovered by spec-compliant agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, etc.) via filesystem scan — no consumer-side CLI required.
  - Remove the `autotel/workers` and `autotel/cloudflare` entry points from `autotel`. Cloudflare Workers users should import directly from `autotel-cloudflare` (and its `/logger`, `/sampling`, `/events` subpaths). `autotel` no longer peer-depends on `autotel-cloudflare` or `autotel-edge`.
  - Strip non-spec frontmatter (`type`, `library`, `library_version`, `sources`, `requires`) from all `SKILL.md` files; keep only spec-defined fields (`name`, `description`, optional `license`).
  - Move user-facing skills (`migrate-to-autotel`, `tune-sampling`, `debug-missing-spans`, `build-audit-trails`) into `packages/autotel/skills/` so consumers receive them automatically via npm. Contributor-only skills (`create-autotel-adapter`, `create-autotel-instrumentation`, `create-autotel-exporter`) remain under the repo-root `skills/` directory.
  - Realign `autotel`'s peer dependency ranges to match published versions on npm.
  - Release workflow now refreshes `pnpm-lock.yaml` after `changeset version` so the next Version Packages PR ships with a consistent lockfile.

### Patch Changes

- 5d05a3e: Add Cloudflare Workers support to main `autotel` package.

### Patch Changes

- 1fa99a0: Fix duplicate `drizzle.*` spans. `instrumentDrizzleClient` no longer instruments `db.$client` — drizzle's session internally dispatches to that same client from within its already-traced prepared query `execute`, which caused every query to emit nested duplicate spans with identical `db.statement`. Session-level instrumentation is now the single source of truth. Consumers who need to trace a standalone client without a drizzle wrapper can still call `instrumentDrizzle(client)` directly.

### Patch Changes

- 8003fad: feat: migrate autotel-devtools into monorepo and upgrade to TypeScript 6.0
  - migrate `autotel-devtools` (standalone OTLP receiver + Preact web UI) into the monorepo with tsup server build and Vite IIFE widget build
  - add `devtools` support to `autotel.init()` for local `autotel-devtools` usage, including optional embedded startup and shutdown cleanup
  - improve `autotel-web` browser span export behavior by avoiding exporter recursion, feature-detecting `sendBeacon`, and reading HTTP methods from `Request` objects
  - narrow the `autotel-edge` factory marker fix to source code so downstream bundlers do not misoptimize required initializers
  - upgrade all packages to TypeScript 6.0: add `tsconfig.build.json` with `ignoreDeprecations: "6.0"` for tsup DTS generation, add explicit `"types": ["node"]` where missing, set `rootDir` where needed
  - fix Astro docs content collection config for Starlight loader API change
  - fix Playwright version mismatch between autotel-playwright and example-playwright-e2e
  - add `@tanstack/intent` to autotel runtime dependencies (required by published bin)
