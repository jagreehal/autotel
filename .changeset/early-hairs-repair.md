Close the loop from "code declares the event contract" through to "catalog reflects the runtime" — schemas declared at the `track()` call site flow through telemetry into the catalog generator and drift detector with no inference guesswork.

### `autotel`

- **New: `defineEvent(name, schema, options?)`.** Returns a `DefinedEvent` that validates the payload at runtime (via the schema's `safeParse`) and carries the JSON Schema and a stable SHA-256 schema hash through `track()` as part of the `EventTrackingOptions`. Designed for Zod (`{ toJsonSchema: (s) => z.toJSONSchema(s) }`) but accepts any schema with a `safeParse` method. Imported from `autotel`.
- **New `schema?: EventSchemaMetadata` field** on `EventTrackingOptions`. The `EventQueue` carries it onto the `EventPayload` so any contract-aware subscriber (`ArchitectureSnapshotSubscriber`, custom subscribers) sees the declared schema verbatim. Optional and backwards-compatible — bare `track()` calls continue to work.
- **PII redaction now only applies to string values.** The default sensitive-key patterns (`/token/i`, `/auth/i`, …) used to overwrite *any* matching value — including numbers and booleans — with the literal string `"[REDACTED]"`. That broke type stability for fields like `promptTokens` / `completionTokens` (LLM usage counters) and gave nothing in return: secrets in user code are overwhelmingly strings. Numeric and boolean attributes now pass through untouched. Same change applied to `AttributeRedactingProcessor`. Existing tests that asserted booleans got redacted have been updated to reflect the new (correct) behaviour.

### `autotel-subscribers`

- **`ArchitectureSnapshotSubscriber` records `fieldStats` for every observed event.** For each dotted field path it tracks the runtime types it saw (`string`, `number`, `object`, …) and up to 20 primitive sample values, merging across observations. The new `FieldStats` type is added to `EventObservation`. Existing snapshots stay valid — `fieldStats` is optional.
- **Captures declared schemas from `defineEvent`.** When a `track()` call originated from `defineEvent`, the subscriber stores the declared `{ source: 'zod', jsonSchema, hash }` on the observation as `EventObservation.schema?`. Snapshots that go through bare `track()` are unchanged.
- **Captures consumer-service attribution.** A new optional `_autotel.consumers: string[]` convention on the event attributes is read into `EventObservation.consumers?`, so the snapshot now describes consumer relationships in addition to producer / channel.

### `autotel-eventcatalog`

- **New `generate` command** — scaffolds services, events, channels, and producer/consumer/channel-routing edges from a snapshot. Skip-if-exists: catalog files that already exist are left completely untouched. When the snapshot's `EventObservation.schema?.jsonSchema` is present (declared at the `track()` call site), it is written verbatim to the event's `schema.json`. Otherwise the schema is inferred from runtime `fieldStats` as a fallback — captured in the operations log as `schemaSource: 'declared' | 'inferred'`. CLI flags: `--snapshot`, `--catalog`, `--dry-run`, `--edges-only`, `--version`, `--summary-output`. Versioned summary envelope (`schemas/generate-summary-v0.1.0.json`) pinned by a contract test.
- **Type drift and value drift** — `diffCatalogAgainstSnapshot` now consumes `fieldStats` to detect runtime-vs-declared mismatches. Drift detector handles the JSON Schema `integer` vs JS `number` impedance mismatch deliberately: declared `integer` accepts observed `number` at the type level, but sample values are checked against `Number.isInteger` — so a runtime `1.5` against an `integer` declaration still flags. No false positives on integer fields, no swept-under-the-rug genuine signal. New `drift-report-v0.2.0.json` and `drift-summary-v0.2.0.json` schemas pin the richer wire format; v0.1.0 envelopes are still emitted for backwards-compatible consumers.
- **`SnapshotDiff` interop renderer** — `toSnapshotDiffFromReport(report)` and `toSnapshotDiffFromDelta(delta)` produce EventCatalog's own `SnapshotDiff` shape (with `ResourceChange[]` and `RelationshipChange[]`), so drift findings can flow into upstream catalog tooling that already understands that format. Exposed as the new `eventcatalog-snapshot-diff` renderer.
- **Catalog state now read via `@eventcatalog/sdk`** instead of a bespoke filesystem walker. `CatalogEvent`, `CatalogService` and `CatalogChannel` extend the SDK's `Event`, `Service` and `Channel` types directly, so any field the SDK adds in future is picked up without changes here. The package gains `@eventcatalog/sdk` as a runtime dependency.
- **Workaround for an upstream SDK bug** — `addEventToChannel` in `@eventcatalog/sdk@2.21.2` corrupts catalog layout (turns `index.mdx` into a directory) because of a string-vs-regex bug in path splitting. `generate` sets the channel pointer directly on the event's frontmatter when calling `writeEvent`, sidestepping the bad code path. The fix is filed upstream as [event-catalog/eventcatalog#2567](https://github.com/event-catalog/eventcatalog/pull/2567); the workaround can be removed once that ships.

### What this means in practice

The reference app (`apps/example-eventcatalog`) has been migrated to `defineEvent` for all five domain events. Running `pnpm services:snapshot && pnpm catalog:drift` against the resulting catalog now prints `No drift detected. Catalog and runtime agree.` That's the steady-state goal — every additional drift finding from here is genuine signal of code-vs-catalog divergence.
